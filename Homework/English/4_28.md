Trump not only didn't take timely response measures to prevent pandemic but also claimed that the risk is lower than we think, which is fatuous and irresponsible. Since January 22., Trump had insisting that pandemic was totally under control and it will be gone soon. but we saw nothing he do, and facts proof that the case of pandemic was worse and worse. Trump had no vigilance before March 16. But it's not in time. Their guidelines was extending again and again. Evidently the case was out of control. It is Trump's innocence that accelerated the spread of virus. Facing pandemic, We are not allowed relax. Only do we devote ourselves to defind virus, the pandemic will leave really. Wish that peple all over the world all were helthy.
