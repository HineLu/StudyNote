Both of Eastern and Western parents want to children live well. But what they do is different. In China, parents usually impose their idea on their children. if their children don't obay the idea of parents, they may be thought as a unfilial person in moral, while in western, parents respect children's thought. They will negotiate with their children.  
不管东西方, 父母都想孩子过得好, 但他们的所作所为却有所不同. 在中国, 父母通常会将自己的想法强加到孩子身上. 如果孩子不服从父母的想法, 在道德上可能会被认为不孝, 而在西方, 父母尊重子女的想法, 他们会跟他们的孩子商讨.
